# Overview
The Cities data set contains hypothetical data on 174 U.S. cities. The following variables are included in this data set:

# Variables 
* SIZE: 	number of inhabitants (in tens of thousands)
* POV: 	percent of inhabitants living below official poverty line
* UNEMP: 	percent of inhabitants unemployed
* POLICE: 	number of full time police officers (in hundreds)
* CRIME:	number of serious crimes during year (in thousands) (dependent variable)

# Analysis 
* I specify a multiple regression model in which CRIME (DV) is regressed on SIZE and POV.
* I investigate whether the effect of poverty on crime is magnified in big cities. To test this hypothesis, it is necessary to compute a new variable that is the product of POV and SIZE.
